# Random Password Generator in C

This is a simple **random password generator** written in **C**. It generates a password of a user-defined length using a mix of **uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters**.

## Features
- Generates a secure random password.
- Uses a predefined set of characters.
- Validates the user input to ensure the password length is positive.

## Requirements
- **C compiler** (e.g., `gcc`)
- Works on **Windows, Linux, and macOS**

## How to Compile & Run
```sh
# Compile the program
gcc main.c -o password_generator

# Run the program
./password_generator
```

## Example Output
```
Enter password length: 12
Generated Password: A3!bC9#dEfG$
```

## Future Improvements
- Allow users to select character types (letters, numbers, symbols).
- Improve randomness using a cryptographic library.
- Save generated passwords to a file.
